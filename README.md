### **TINJI is NFT Marketing Tool**

**Low cost, High performance with Dynamic NFTs.**

Local businesses can attract local customers by airdropping dNFTs. The ads can reach customers 100% by making them swipe the dNFTs to receive them. This way, local businesses can decrease marketing costs and increase their advertising performance. Additionally, users can earn coupon benefits and tokens by viewing the ads.

## Demo

https://tinji-web.vercel.app/


# 
.
 
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
